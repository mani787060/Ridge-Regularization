# Ridge Regularization (L2)

-> This project implements **Ridge Regression**, a regularized linear regression technique that uses L2 penalty to prevent overfitting.  
-> It includes a step-by-step explanation, manual implementation, and comparison with sklearn’s Ridge model.

## Contents:-
-> Ridge Regression **from scratch using NumPy**
-> Ridge Regression using **sklearn Ridge**
-> Understanding the L2 penalty (lambda/alpha)
-> Effect of regularization on model coefficients
-> Visualization of coefficient shrinkage

## Key Concepts:-
-> Why regularization is needed
-> Overfitting vs underfitting behavior
-> Role of alpha (regularization strength)

## Libraries Used:-
-> NumPy  
-> Pandas  
-> Matplotlib  
-> Scikit-learn
